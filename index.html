							<h2>ZLC Financial - Data Analyst</h2>
							<p>In this contract position, I migrated financial data to a new CRM system to enhance customer service and improve client relations for over 20 financial advisors by extracting, auditing, and consolidating their client data. 
							I was able to expedite the migration process by a month by implementing a new pipeline to audit large datasets by automating data integrity review process.</p>
							<p>As a data analyst, I want to work with different types of data, and financial data was on top of my list. This position helped me understand financial data closely.</p>

							<h2>Lakehead University - Research Data Analyst</h2>
							<p>For my master's thesis, I used data analysis techniques to examine the services being provided by family physicians in Ontario using a physician billing database to improve health human resource planning.</p>
							<p>During this research, I learned how to ask the right questions to include all the research requirements to solve the problem. I also managed a dataset of 90 million records with complete data integrity. Furthermore, I analyzed the dataset by developing several machine learning models to predict and better understand the variables. Finally, I grasped the skill of sharing my analysis using beautiful and easy-to-read visualizations.</p>
							<p>This was my passion project! It aligned with my life-long goal of helping people, and here is where I first fell in love with data.</p>
							<p>Here are some of the publications from this research:

							<h2>Communica - ML Developer</h2>
							<p>Communica, a stakeholder-engagement consulting firm based in Calgary, Alberta, works towards connecting, engaging, and collaborating with clients and their stakeholders in a real, pragmatic and thoughtful manner. In other words, they have a lot of communication data, from emails to phone records which need to be analyzed.</p>
							<p>That's where I come in! In my contract position, I helped Communica automate text-analyzing processes by preparing an end-to-end NLP solution for text extraction, text summarization, and text proof-reading using a scalable ETL pipeline with Microsoft Azure services. I also developed and implemented scalable python applications for text retrieval and indexing that reduced email review time by 200x.</p>
							<p>Most importantly, during my time here, I learned how to share results in stakeholder meetings, where the audience was from technical and non-technical backgrounds. I think this is a critical skill for a data analyst. I'm grateful to have had that experience during my time in this role.</p>
