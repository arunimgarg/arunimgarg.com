							<h2>Lakehead Univesity - Research Data Analyst</h2>
							<p>For my master's thesis, I used data analytics techniques to examine the services being provided by family physicians in Ontario using a physician billing database to improve health human resource planning.</p>
							<p>During the course of this research, I learned how to ask the right questions to include all the research requirements to solve the problem. I also managed a dataset of 90 million records with complete data integrity and analyzed the dataset by developing several machine learning models to predict and better understand the variables. Finally, I grasped the skill of sharing my analysis using beautiful and easy-to-read visualizations.</p>
							<p>This was my passion project! It aligned with my life-long goal of helping people and here is where I first fell in love with data.</p>
							<p>Here are some of the publications from this research:

							<h2>Communica - ML Developer</h2>
							<p>Communica, a stakeholder-engagment consulting firm based in Calgary, Alberta, works towards connecting, engaging and collaborating with clients and their stakeholders in a real, pragmatic and thoughtful manner. In other words, they have a lot of communication data, from emails to phone records which need to be analyzed.</p>
							<p>That's where I come in! In my contract position, I helped Communica with automation of text-analyzing processes by preparing an end-to-end NLP solution for text extraction, text summarization, and text proof-reading using a scalable ETL pipeline with Microsoft Azure services. I also developed and implemented scalable python applications for text retrieval and indexing that reduced email review time by 200x.</p>
							<p>During my time here, most importantly I learned how to share results in stakeholder meetings, where the audience was both from technical and non-technical backgrounds. I think this is immensely important skill for a data analyst, and I'm grateful to have that experience during my time in this role.</p>

							<h2>Lakehead University - Graduate Assistant</h2>
							<p>During the time of my master's degree, I assisted several professors with conducting lectures, heading lab tutorials, and curating curriculum for various courses like cloud computing, software engineering, operating system, and Android development.</p>
							<p>This role reignited my passion of public-speaking, but in a more professional setting. </p>
