Hi, I'm a future data scientist looking to make data-driven decisions to impact the world positively. I'm a recent data analyst, and a current data engineer. I recently finished my master's degree in computer science in 2021 and my research papers can be found here.

I have made this website to keep track of my projects and give you a summary of my work experience so far.

To-do:
Projects - 
1. Eisenhower Matrix - a) add checkboxes for each new task b) update CSS for mobile screens (webpage looks good only on a laptop screen right now)
