            <p>The Eisenhower Matrix is named after former US President Dwight D. Eisenhower. It's based on the idea that you 
              should divide your tasks into four quadrants based on their urgency and importance. The four quadrants are Urgent and important, 
              not urgent and important, urgent and not important, and not urgent and not important.

          <p>I was very intrigued by this new tool that I had learned, but when I went online, I saw some online applications available but behind a sign-up wall. So 
          I decided to implement this using simple HTML, CSS, and JS. Not well-versed in JS, this would be a great brush-up on the language.</p>
