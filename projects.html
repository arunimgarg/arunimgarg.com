            <p>The Eisenhower Matrix is named after former US President Dwight D. Eisenhower. It's based on the idea that you 
              should divide your tasks into four quadrants, based on their urgency and importance. The four quadrants are: Urgent and important, 
              not urgent and important, urgent and not important, and not urgent and not important.

          <p>I wanted to make this productivity tool for myself and when I went online I saw there were some tools like this available but behind a sign-up wall. So 
          I decided to make this using a simple implementation of html, css, and js. Not well-versed at js, I thought this would be a great brush up on the language.</p>
