You only live once. The cards have been dealt to you. At a poker table, you can just get up and leave if you don’t like your cards - 
you’ll lose the money you put up, you’ll lose the chance to play at the same table again, and if you do that at a lot of tables you 
play you won’t even be allowed to be back at that casino and then eventually at any casino. In life, though, it’s worse. You can’t 
even just get up and leave if you don’t like the cards that life has dealt to you. So you might as well play the hand. And since you 
will play the hand, you might as well play it the best way you can. Marcus Aurelius said, “Here is a rule to remember in future, when 
anything tempts you to feel bitter: not "This is misfortune," but "To bear this worthily is good fortune.”
If you’re living a life that you think is bitter and unfortunate because of the people in your life, if you think you’re trapped with 
others and unable to live as free as you want it to be, you may be right in your feelings. You are maybe stuck in a life where you have 
responsibilities that you don’t like or ask for. You may be stuck in a life where you must do what others want because you depend on them. 
But those are the cards you were dealt. You have only one life. This life. You are living it. You might as well enjoy it. Easier said than 
done. But, trying to keep doing what you are made to do with a positive mindset, inner dialogue, positive perspective of life, and passion 
for life is the way to play the cards right. It’s hard to do. You betcha. But this is a reminder that you might as well try.
